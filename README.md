# NatureQuiz

NatureQuiz is an Android game where you can select nature-related category from which you will be shown pictures and then you need to know the answer. It is a game to test your knowledge and also to teach you more about the nature. It can be educational also for the developers. It was made to learn more about Android programming and to learn more about nature.

Technically the game itself is quite simple. It requires no special functionality or anything so it should be working even with older Androids and devices. It has a lot of images so it requires some space to install but memory-usage should still be rather low.

Categories can be added as easily as adding new XML files. They are located under assets/categories. XML files refer to string-resources to each attribute can be localized. Images for each category and level are located under assets/images. Currently the game has only English, Finnish and Russian. Translations and the content has not been checked by professionals so some minor errors are possible.

Most likely I won't be developing the game anymore â€“ so feel free to make a fork and continue to develop and improve it!
