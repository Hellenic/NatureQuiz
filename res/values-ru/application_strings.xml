    <string name="help_description">"Nature Quiz will show you various pictures and then you need to type in the name of the object in the picture. For example, if picture of bear is shown to you, you need to type in 'bear'. You do not need to know if it's a grey bear or brown bear, so just 'bear' is enough.\n
        To play Nature Quiz you first select 'Play' on the first screen. On the second screen, you select the category you want to try out. After that you can see the pictures and if you want, you can browse between them if you don't want to answer (or just don't know) all of them.\n
        Have a great time with Nature Quiz!\n
